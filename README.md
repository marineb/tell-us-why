# Know someone who didn't vote?

## About this project
Half of Americans didn't vote in the last election. We need you to help us find out why. Ask friends and strangers around you whether or not they voted in the last election. If they didn't, ask them these survey questions. The answers will be collected and used to help get more Americans voting.
